                                <p>Dear Steve,</p>
                                <p>
                                    Your extraordinary career, your extraordinary life, is a
                                    testament to the power of innovation, creative genius, and
                                    perseverance.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Born to a single mother and adopted by a loving couple, you
                                    have faced many personal challenges since childhood. Your
                                    adoption by Paul and Clara Jobs was the first step on a path
                                    that would change the world.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    One of the most fascinating anecdotes is about your decision
                                    to drop out of Reed College after just one semester. Despite
                                    this, you continued to attend calligraphy classes that
                                    profoundly influenced the aesthetic design of early
                                    Macintosh computers. This attention to detail is what has
                                    made Apple products so distinctive and intuitive. As you've
                                    often said, this calligraphy course sparked a passion for
                                    typography that would later become one of the hallmarks of
                                    Apple products.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In 1976, together with your friend Steve Wozniak, you
                                    founded Apple in your parents' garage. This humble departure
                                    didn't stop your vision of transforming the world of
                                    technology. The introduction of the Apple I and later the
                                    Apple II revolutionized the personal computer industry,
                                    making them accessible to a wide range of users. To finance
                                    the production of the Apple I, you even sold your Volkswagen
                                    minivan while Wozniak sold his HP calculator.

                                    One of the most emblematic anecdotes concerns the launch of
                                    the Macintosh in 1984. With the legendary
                                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErwS24cBZPc" target="_blank">commercial
                                        directed by Ridley Scott</a>, broadcast during the Super Bowl, you introduced
                                    the world
                                    to a computer with a revolutionary graphical interface. This
                                    event has permanently changed the way we interact with
                                    computers.

                                    Retiring from Apple in 1985 was one of the most difficult
                                    experiences of your career.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Instead of giving up, you founded NeXT, a company that would
                                    later develop core technologies that would be integrated
                                    into future Apple products.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The NeXTcube workstation, although not a commercial success,
                                    was a concentrate of technological innovation and design.
                                    The NeXT computers featured a cubic black magnesium case,
                                    designed by Frogdesign, reflecting your vision of sublime
                                    elegance and rugged construction.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The NeXTSTEP operating system, developed for NeXT computers,
                                    was known for its innovative graphical user interface and
                                    powerful object-oriented programming capabilities. This
                                    technology was then the basis of the development of macOS
                                    when Apple acquired NeXT.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Another fascinating detail is the NeXT logo, created by the
                                    famous designer Paul Rand. The logo, a three-dimensional
                                    cube with the colored letters "NeXT" arranged on different
                                    faces, symbolized the dynamism and modernity of the company.
                                    The collaboration with Rand ensured that the logo reflected
                                    NeXT's core values: innovation, avant-garde and elegance.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Apple's acquisition of NeXT in 1997 for $429 million was a
                                    brilliant ploy that allowed you to re-enter Apple and lead
                                    it into a new era of extraordinary success. The NeXTSTEP
                                    operating system became the heart of macOS, which powers
                                    Apple products to this day.
                                </p>

                                    Under your leadership, Apple introduced groundbreaking
                                    products such as the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad,
                                    transforming it into one of the most valuable and
                                    influential companies in the world. Your ability to combine
                                    advanced technology with a sleek, user-friendly design has
                                    changed the landscape of digital technologies forever.

                                    A curious anecdote concerns your meticulousness in the
                                    design and packaging of Apple products. You're famous for
                                    saying, "Design is not just what it looks like and feels
                                    like. Design is how it works." This philosophy has guided
                                    every design decision, from the simplicity of the products
                                    to the opening of the boxes, creating a unique user
                                    experience. In fact, it is said that you also paid
                                    meticulous attention to the design of the internal
                                    components of Apple products, visible only to engineers,
                                    insisting that "purity of design had to be present at every
                                    level."
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Your passion for cars is well known, with the Porsche 959
                                    being an example of your attraction to technology and
                                    innovation even outside the IT field. Interestingly, the
                                    Porsche 959 wasn't homologated for US roads until 1999, but
                                    the TV series "60 Minutes" reported that you had a crush on
                                    this model before it was even legal in the US.
                                </p>

                                    Your life is also an example of personal resilience. Despite
                                    the constant battles with health, you have maintained a
                                    clear vision and an unwavering passion for innovation until
                                    the end. After your diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in 2004,
                                    you continued to lead Apple with the same energy and
                                    creativity as always. Your ability to meet these challenges
                                    with courage and determination has inspired millions.

                                    One of the most memorable speeches of your career was
                                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oObxNDYyZPs" target="_blank">the one you
                                        gave at Stanford University in 2005</a>. During this inaugural address, you
                                    shared three personal

                                    Disney's acquisition of Pixar in 2006 for $7.4 billion was a
                                    strategic move that had a significant impact on the
                                    entertainment industry. This deal not only made you Disney's
                                    largest individual shareholder, with about 7% of the
                                    company's shares, but it also marked a fundamental change in
                                    the trajectory of both companies.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Pixar, under your leadership, had established itself as a
                                    creative powerhouse in the animation industry, with
                                    resounding hits such as 'Toy Story', 'A Bug's Life',
                                    'Monsters, Inc.' and 'Finding Nemo'. Through a team of
                                    talented animators and your innovative vision, Pixar had
                                    shown the world the potential of computer animation with
                                    deep and engaging narratives.

                                    The acquisition was beneficial for Disney, which at the time
                                    was looking to reinvigorate its once-dominant animation
                                    department but had lost its luster in previous years. Your
                                    joining Disney's board of directors not only brought an
                                    influx of new ideas and leadership, but also the
                                    implementation of a company culture focused on innovation
                                    and quality.

                                    The merger with Pixar brought Disney back to the forefront
                                    of animation, ushering in a new era of success with films
                                    such as 'Ratatouille', 'WALL-E', 'Up', and 'Toy Story 3'.

                                    Inoltre, la tua influenza si estese oltre l’animazione. Con
                                    il tuo ingresso nel consiglio di amministrazione di Disney,
                                    sei diventato una voce importante nelle decisioni
                                    strategiche dell’azienda, influenzando progetti di
                                    espansione e l’integrazione tecnologica. Questa acquisizione
                                    consolidò la tua posizione non solo come un iconico leader
                                    tecnologico, ma anche come un titano dell’intrattenimento
                                    globale.

                                    Infine, la creazione degli Apple Store è un altro esempio
                                    del tuo pensiero innovativo. La tua visione di creare negozi
                                    fisici dove i clienti potessero vivere un’esperienza unica
                                    con i prodotti Apple ha trasformato il retail. Il primo
                                    Apple Store aprì nel 2001 e divenne rapidamente un fenomeno
                                    nel settore delle vendite al dettaglio.
